# üß† PyQuizMaster: The Weighted Learning Engine

**A dual-platform (Desktop & Web) diagnostic quiz system designed for serious learners and intellectual performance tracking.**

PyQuizMaster moves beyond standard testing by implementing a powerful **Weighted Scoring Engine**, where question difficulty directly impacts point value (e.g., CS questions are worth more than GK), providing a true measure of specialized knowledge.
