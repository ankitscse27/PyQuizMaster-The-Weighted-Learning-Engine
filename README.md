# PyQuizMaster-The-Weighted-Learning-Engine
The desktop quiz app built to challenge and track serious learners.

‚ö° Project Overview

PyQuizMaster is a desktop-grade quiz application built with Python and customtkinter for a sleek, responsive UI. It moves beyond standard tests by featuring a powerful weighted scoring engine: hard questions (CS) are worth more points than easy ones (GK).

It‚Äôs a true diagnostic tool, offering:

Persistent History: Tracks and saves your last 10 performance sessions locally.

Real-Time Metrics: Progress bar, live timer, and instant score updates.

Rapid Workflow: Full support for keyboard shortcuts (1-4, Enter).

Detailed Review: Comprehensive post-quiz analysis and mistake breakdown.

This is not just a quiz‚Äîit's an advanced system for intellectual performance tracking.
